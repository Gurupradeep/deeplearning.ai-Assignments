# Deep Learning Specialisation
Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repository contains all the solutions of the programming assignments along with few output images. It also has some of the important papers which are referred during the course. 

**NOTE :** Use the solutions only for reference purpose :)

This specialisation has five courses.
